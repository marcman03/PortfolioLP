                        <p>
                            I envisioned developing a decentralized voting system using blockchain technology, 
                            but for this project, I implemented a conventional database to explore what kind of data would need to be stored.
                            This helped me understand the structure required for a future blockchain implementation.
                        </p>

                        <ul class="objectives">
                            <li>Create an intuitive interface to manage large sets of data.</li>
                            <li>Develop a script to generate and populate a database with millions of records.</li>
                            <li>Simulate a secure voting system where votes can be reviewed on a "blockchain".</li>
                            <li>Create two user roles: one who can generate votes (administrator) and another who can vote (member).</li>

                            One of the most valuable lessons I learned in this project was how to efficiently handle large amounts of data. 
                            By developing a script that generated millions of records and implementing a system capable of managing these volumes, 
                            I gained a deep understanding of the challenges and strategies involved in large-scale data management.

                        <p>
                            In this project, I developed an AI to play checkers using the Minimax algorithm with enhancements like Iterative Deepening Search (IDS) and Zobrist hashing for board state optimization. 
                            The project was done in collaboration with a friend, based on an environment provided by my professor, which included a pre-built checkers board and various helper functions to manage the game's logic and state.
                            This foundation allowed us to focus on implementing and optimizing the AI algorithms to make the player more competitive.
                        </p>

                            <li>Implement the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for decision-making in a checkers game.</li>
                            <li>Create two AI players: one using Iterative Deepening Search (IDS) with a time constraint and another using a fixed depth limit for the Minimax search.</li>
                            <li>Optimize board evaluations using Zobrist hashing to speed up move generation and avoid redundant calculations.</li>
                            <li>Design a robust heuristic based on piece counting, triangular formations, and trap identification to improve AI decision-making.</li>

                            This project taught me how to efficiently apply the Minimax algorithm in a real-world scenario by integrating optimization techniques such as Zobrist hashing and IDS. 
                            I learned how to handle time constraints while maintaining competitive performance and how to balance the trade-offs between search depth and computational speed.

                                    Despite the IDS consistently exploring 2 or 3 levels more, they manage to reach a draw.

                                     We can conclude that it descends 2 or 3 more levels thanks to the hash table with the Zobrist algorithm.

                                    The black player wins decisively, using the same heuristic as the white player. Given that IDS explores more levels, it allows for better decision-making and superior strategic play.

The cloud is responsible for calculating routes, storing data, and making decisions. The web platform and mobile app send client requests and receive vehicle positions via an API. Controllers manage the vehicles in real-time, receiving data from the cloud and relaying it to the vehicles, which are equipped with sensors. MongoDB is used for data storage, allowing the system to access and process large amounts of information efficiently.

                            PETSALUT is a project we developed as a group, working with Agile methodologies in .NET. The goal of the project was to create a social network for pet owners where they could organize and participate in both public and private events. Public events, similar to an Instagram feed, could include activities like meet-ups or walks created by pet owners, and other users could join them. Additionally, there was a private section for veterinary clinics to manage consultations for pet health issues.

                            This project is a C++ implementation of the Huffman compression algorithm. Huffman encoding is a lossless data compression technique that assigns shorter binary codes to more frequent characters in a dataset, and longer codes to less frequent characters. The project involves reading a text file, generating a frequency table, constructing the Huffman tree, encoding the text, and displaying the results.
